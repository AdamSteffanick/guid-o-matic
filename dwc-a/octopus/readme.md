# Darwin Core Archive RDF Octopus project

The files in this folder are the files needed to generate Guid-O-Matic on the fielded text files present in Darwin Core archives described in the blog post Guid-O-Matic meets the DwC-A Octopus.  For the publicly available archives, a link to the archive is given in the readme.txt file in the appropriate subfolder.

The data from Anne Thessen microbial eukaryotes for EOL TraitBank is not to my knowledge publicly available.  Contact her for more information.
