# Darwin Core Archive RDF Octopus project

The files in this folder are the files needed by Guid-O-Matic to generate RDF from the fielded text files present in Darwin Core archives described in the blog post [Guid-O-Matic meets the DwC-A Octopuses](http://baskauf.blogspot.com/2016/11/guid-o-matic-meets-dwc-rdf-octopus.html).  For the publicly available archives, a link to the archive is given in the readme.txt file in the appropriate subfolder.

The data from Anne Thessen microbial eukaryotes for EOL TraitBank is not to my knowledge publicly available.  Contact her for more information.

The [octopus.zip file](octopus.zip) (34 Mb) contains all of the generated RDF graphs in Turtle serialization.  It does not contain the Bioimages triples (in XML serialization), which can be downloaded separately [here](https://github.com/baskaufs/Bioimages/blob/master/bioimages-rdf.zip).
